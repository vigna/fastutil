/** Lightweight, unsynchronized, aligned input stream buffering class with
 *  {@linkplain #skip(long) true skipping},
 *  {@linkplain MeasurableStream measurability},
 *  {@linkplain RepositionableStream repositionability}
 *  and {@linkplain #readLine(byte[], int, int, EnumSet) line reading} support.
 *
 * <p>This class provides buffering for input streams, but it does so with
 * purposes and an internal logic that are radically different from the ones
 * adopted in {@link java.io.BufferedInputStream}. The main features follow.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><p>There is no support for marking. All methods are unsychronized.
 *
 * <li><p>As an additional feature, this class implements the {@link
 * RepositionableStream} and {@link MeasurableStream} interfaces.
 * An instance of this class will try to cast
 * the underlying byte stream to a {@link RepositionableStream} and to fetch by
 * reflection the {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel} underlying the given
 * output stream, in this order. If either reference can be successfully
 * fetched, you can use {@link #position(long)} to reposition the stream.
 * Much in the same way, an instance of this class will try to cast the
 * the underlying byte stream to a {@link MeasurableStream}, and if this
 * operation is successful, or if a {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel} can
 * be detected, then {@link #position()} and {@link #length()} will work as expected.
 *
 *
 * <li><p>Due to erratic and unpredictable behaviour of {@link InputStream#skip(long)},
 * which does not correspond to its specification and which Sun refuses to fix
 * (see <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6222822">bug 6222822</a>;
 * don't be fooled by the &ldquo;closed, fixed&rdquo; label),
 * this class peeks at the underlying stream and if it is {@link System#in} it uses
 * repeated reads instead of calling {@link InputStream#skip(long)} on the underlying stream; moreover,
 * skips and reads are tried alternately, so to guarantee that skipping
 * less bytes than requested can be caused only by reaching the end of file.
 *
 * <li><p>This class keeps also track of the number of bytes read so far, so
 * to be able to implement {@link MeasurableStream#position()}
 * independently of underlying input stream.
 *
 * <li><p>This class has limited support for
 * {@linkplain #readLine(byte[], int, int, EnumSet) &ldquo;reading a line&rdquo;}
 * (whatever that means) from the underlying input stream. You can choose the set of
 * {@linkplain FastBufferedInputStream.LineTerminator line terminators} that
 * delimit lines.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Since {@code fastutil} 6.0.0, this class detects
 * a implementations of {@link MeasurableStream} instead of subclasses {@code MeasurableInputStream} (which is deprecated).
 *
 * @since 4.4

	 *
	 * <p>Reading lines (i.e., characters) out of a byte stream is not always sensible
	 * (methods available to that purpose in old versions of Java have been mercilessly deprecated).
	 * Nonetheless, in several situations, such as when decoding network protocols or headers
	 * known to be ASCII, it is very useful to be able to read a line from a byte stream.
	 *
	 * <p>This method will attempt to read the next line into {@code array} starting at {@code off},
	 * reading at most {@code len} bytes. The read, however, will be stopped by the end of file or
	 * when meeting a {@linkplain LineTerminator <em>line terminator</em>}. Of course, for this operation
	 * to be sensible the encoding of the text contained in the stream, if any, must not generate spurious
	 * carriage returns or line feeds. Note that the termination detection uses a maximisation
	 * criterion, so if you specify both {@link LineTerminator#CR} and
	 * {@link LineTerminator#CR_LF} meeting a pair CR/LF will consider the whole pair a terminator.
	 *
	 * <p>Terminators are <em>not</em> copied into <em>array</em> or included in the returned count. The
	 * returned integer can be used to check whether the line is complete: if it is smaller than
	 * {@code len}, then more bytes might be available, but note that this method (contrarily
	 * to {@link #read(byte[], int, int)}) can legitimately return zero when {@code len}
	 * is nonzero just because a terminator was found as the first character. Thus, the intended
	 * usage of this method is to call it on a given array, check whether {@code len} bytes
	 * have been read, and if so try again (possibly extending the array) until a number of read bytes
	 * strictly smaller than {@code len} (possibly, -1) is returned.
	 *
	 * <p>If you need to guarantee that a full line is read, use the following idiom:
	 * <pre>
	 * int start = off, len;
	 * while((len = fbis.readLine(array, start, array.length - start, terminators)) == array.length - start) {
	 *     start += len;
	 *     array = ByteArrays.grow(array, array.length + 1);
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * <p>At the end of the loop, the line will be placed in {@code array} starting at
	 * {@code off} (inclusive) and ending at {@code start + Math.max(len, 0)} (exclusive).
	 *
	 * @param array byte array where the next line will be stored.
	 * @param off the first byte to use in {@code array}.
	 * @param len the maximum number of bytes to read.
	 * @param terminators a set containing the line termination sequences that we want
	 * to consider as valid.
	 * @return the number of bytes actually placed in {@code array}, or -1 at end of file.
	 * Note that the returned number will be {@code len} if no line termination sequence
	 * specified in {@code terminators} has been met before scanning {@code len} byte,
	 * and if also we did not meet the end of file.
