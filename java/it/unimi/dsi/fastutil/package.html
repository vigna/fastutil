	 <P>Provides type-specialized hash maps and sets with a small memory
	 footprint and much (2 to 10 times) faster access and insertion. It is <A
	 HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</A>
	 distributed under the <A
	 HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"><ACRONYM TITLE="GNU's not
	 Unix">GNU</ACRONYM> General Public License</A>.

	 <h2>Package Specification</h2>

	 <p>The classes of this package specialize the most useful {@link
	 java.util.HashSet} and {@link java.util.HashMap} classes to versions that
	 accept a specific kind of key or value.

	 The general format is</p>
		<div style="padding: 1em">
		  <var>valuetype</var> <var>settype</var>
		</div>
		<p>for sets, and</p>
		<div style="padding: 1em">
		  <var>keytype</var> 2 <var>valuetype</var> <var>maptype</var>
		</div>
	 <p>for maps.Thus, an {@link it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.IntHashSet} stores
	 integers efficiently, whereas a {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.Long2IntHashMap} does the same for maps from long
	 integers to integers. By "type" here I mean a capitalized primitive type,
	 or {@link java.lang.Object}.</p>
	 
	 <p>Since there are eight primitive types in Java, we get 269 (!) classes
	 (some nonsensical class, such as <code>Boolean2BooleanHashMap</code>, are
	 not generated). Many classes are generated just to mimic the hierarchy of
	 {@link java.util} so to redistribute common code in a similar way.</p>
	 
	 <p><b>All classes are not synchronized</b>. If multiple threads access one
	 of these classes concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies it,
	 it must be synchronized externally. Iterators will behave unpredictably in
	 the presence of concurrent modifications.

	 <h3>Interfaces Implemented</h3>
	 
	 <p>All maps and sets in <code>fastUtil</code> implement their standard
	 counterpart interface (e.g., {@link java.util.Map} for maps). Thus, they
	 can be just plugged in existing code, using the standard access (of course,
	 any attempt to use the wrong type for keys or values will produce a
	 {@link java.lang.ClassCastException}). However, they also provide (whenever
	 possible) many polymorphic versions of the most used methods that allow to
	 avoid the tedious "type juggling" that is well known to Java
	 programmers. In doing so, they implement more stringent interfaces that
	 extend the standard ones.</p>
	 
	 <p>These new interfaces add some methods, which are rather obvious, and I
	 suggest you to have a look at some of them. There are just a few
	 <i>caveat</i>, mainly due to some arbitrary restriction of Java:

	 <ul>
		
		<li>The versions of the {@link java.util.Map#get(Object)}, {@link
		java.util.Map#put(Object,Object)} and {@link
		java.util.Map#remove(Object)} methods that return a primitive type
		cannot, of course, rely on returning <code>null</code> to denote the
		absence of a certain pair. Rather, they return a <em>default return
		value</em>, which is set to 0 cast to the return type(or
		<code>false</code> for booleans) at creation, but can be changed using
		the <code>setDefRetValue()</code> method. Note that
		changing the default return value does not change anything about the data
		structure; it is just a way to return a reasonably meaningful result, and
		it can be changed at any time.</li>

		<li>For all maps that have object as keys, the {@link
		java.util.Map#get(Object)} and {@link java.util.Map#remove(Object)}
		methods do not admit polymorphic versions, as Java does not allow
		return-value polymorphism. Rather, the extended interfaces introduce new
		methods of the form <code>get<var>valuetype</var>()</code> and
		<code>remove<var>valuetype</var>()</code>.

		<li>For the same reason, the method {@link java.util.Collection#toArray}
		has a polymorphic version accepting a type-specific array, but there are
		also explicitly typed methods <code>to<var>keytype</var>Array()</code>.
	 </ul>

	 <h3>Additional Methods</h3>
 
	 <p>Again, due to some limitation of Java (you cannot override covariantly
	 the return value of an interface, i.e., with a method returning a more
	 type-specific value) there are some features of <code>fastUtil</code> that are
	 available only by means of type casting. In particular, keys and values
	 of a map are of the <code>fastUtil</code> type you expect (e.g., the keys
	 of an {@link it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.Int2LongMap} are an {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.IntSet} and the values are a {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.LongCollection}), but you must explicitly cast the
	 objects returned by {@link java.util.Map#keySet()} and {@link
	 java.util.Map#values()} to the appropriate type.

	 <p>Similarly, all iterators have a suitable method
	 <code>next<var>type</var>()</code> returning directly a primitive type:
	 however, you must cast explicitly the object returned by {@link
	 java.util.Set#iterator()} to the appropriate type (e.g., {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.CharIterator} for a {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.CharSet}).

	 <h2>Performance</h2>
	 
	 <p>The main reason behind <code>fastUtil</code> is performance, both in
	 time and in space. The relevant methods are something like 2 to 10 times
	 faster than those of the standard classes. 

	 <p><code>fastUtil</code> reduces enormously the creation and collection of
	 objects. First of all, if you use the polymorphic methods and iterators no
	 wrapper objects have to be created. Moreover, since <code>fastUtil</code>
	 uses open addressing, creation and garbage collection of table entries are
	 avoided (but tables have to be rehashed whenever they are filled
	 beyond the load factor).


	 <h2>Deletions</h2>

	 <p>Since deletions are handled simply by tagging, they are very fast <i>per
	 se</i>, but they tend to slow down subsequent accesses (with respect to a
	 set with no deleted entries). In highly dynamical situations, where entries
	 are continuously created and deleted, unsuccessful searches may take linear
	 time (as <em>all</em> entries must be probed).

	 <p>A partial solution to this problem (which has no known complete solution
	 if you use open addressing with secondary hashing&mdash;cfr. Knuth's
	 section on hashing in the third volume of <em>The Art of Computer
	 Programming</em>) is to call the <code>rehash()</code> method, which will
	 try to rebuild the table remapping all keys.

	 <p>In other words, if your application requires inextricably interleaved
	 insertions, deletions and queries open-addressing implementations (and in
	 particular <code>fastUtil</code> classes) are not the right choice.

	 <p>Note, however, that <code>fastUtil</code> implements a special
	 optimization, usually not found elsewhere, that greatly speeds up probes
	 for recently deleted entries. More details can be found in the
	 documentation of the {@link it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.Hash} interface.

	 <h2>Memory Usage</h2>

	 <p>To avoid memory waste, I keep no additional information about elements
	 (such as a list of keys). In particular, this means that enumerations are
	 always linear in the size of the table (rather than in the number of
	 keys). In general, this would imply slower iterators. Nonetheless, the
	 iterator code includes a single, tight loop; moreover, it is possible to
	 avoid the creation of wrappers. These two facts make in practice
	 <code>fastUtil</code> iterators <em>faster</em> than {@link java.util}'s.

	 <p>The memory footprint for a table with <var>n</var> keys is exactly the
	 memory required for the related types times <var>n</var> bytes, plus a
	 overhead of <var>n</var> bytes to store the state of each entry. The
	 absence of wrappers around primitive types can reduce space occupancy by
	 several times (this applies even more to serialized data, e.g., when you
	 save such a data structure in a file).  These data can greatly vary with
	 your virtual machine, JVM versions, CPU etc.

	 <p>More precisely, when you ask for a map that will hold <var>n</var>
	 elements with load factor 0&lt;<var>f</var>&le;1, <var>p</var> entries are
	 allocated, where <var>p</var> is first prime in {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.Hash#primes} larger than
	 <var>n</var>/<var>f</var>. Primes in {@link
	 it.unimi.dsi.fastUtil.Hash#primes} are roughly multiplicatively spaced by
	 2<sup>1/16</sup>, so you lose on average about 2% with respect to
	 <var>n</var>/<var>f</var>. When the table is filled up beyond the load
	 factor, it is rehashed to a roughly doubled size.

	 <p>An important downside of this design is that <em>hash codes are not
	 cached</em>. Thus, you should not use <code>fastUtil</code> classes with
	 keys having slow equality methods, as a probe requires testing equality
	 with all keys met along the probe sequence.

	 <h2>Robustness</h2>
	 
	 <p>The code in <code>fastUtil</code> has passed intensive regression
	 tests. You can trust it much in the same way you trust the standard
	 classes.</p>
